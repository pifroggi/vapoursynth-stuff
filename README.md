# Vapoursynth Stuff
Some of my Vapoursynth filter scripts ready to run, use as a template, or starting point.  
Currently this houses only one script and one guide.

<br />

### [Vapoursynth Portable Installation Tutorial for Windows](/docs/vapoursynth-portable-setup-tutorial.md)
A short Guide to install Vapoursynth Portable, as well as everything one needs to get started.

<br />

### [Paired Dataset Helper](/paired%20dataset%20helper)
A script to sync and align LQ videos with their HQ counterparts to create paired video or image datasets.  
Optionally match colors, filter unwanted frames, add degredations, crop and resize.
